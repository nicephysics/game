          The player <a href="./controls">controls</a> a simple <a href="./sfo">Spherical Flying Object (SFO)</a>. 
          The aim of the game is to protect as many <a href="./stars-and-planets">planets</a> as possible from incoming 
          <a href="./asteroids">asteroids</a>, by hitting them out of the planet's <a href="./atmosphere">atmosphere</a>.

          Planets orbit around stars, and are where the action of the game take place. 
          The player <a href="./controls">controls</a> the <a href="./sfo">SFO</a> to shoot projectiles 
          that hit away <a href="./asteroids">asteroids</a> flying towards planets out of the 
          <a href="./atmosphere">planet's atmosphere</a>, preventing damage to its surface. 
          Each planet has lives that can be deducted if asteroids hit its surface. 
          The amount of lives a planet has is specific to it. Each star has varying amounts of planets orbiting around it. 
          To unlock stars and their planets, the player has to pass the <a href="./waves">asteroid waves</a> of previous planets.

          Asteroids have varying types, masses, sizes, and shapes. 
          Because of their different masses, they can fly towards the planet as different speeds. 
          There are <a href="./asteroids">different types of asteroids</a> of different difficulties. 
          Some asteroids has a turret attached to it, aiming at the player's <a href="./sfo">SFO</a>. 
          If the spaceship gets hit, it will get stunned! 
          The amount of lives deducted from planets depends on the type of asteroid that hit its surface.
