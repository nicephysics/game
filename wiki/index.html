            The player controls a <a href="./sfo">simple Spherical Flying Object (SFO)</a>. 
            The aim of the game is to protect as many <a href="./planets">planets</a> as possible 
            from incoming <a href="./asteriods">asteroids</a>, 
            by hitting them out of the planet's <a href="./atmosphere">atmosphere</a>.

            <a href="./planets">Planets</a> orbit around stars. 
            Each star has varying amounts of planets orbiting around it. 
            To unlock stars and their planets, the player has to pass the <a href="./waves">asteroid waves</a> of previous planets.

            Planets are where the action of the game takes place. 
            The player controls his/her <a href="./sfo">SFO</a> to shoot projectiles that hit away <a href="./asteroids">asteroids</a> 
            flying towards planets out of the <a href="./atmosphere">planet's atmosphere</a>, preventing damage to its surface. 
            Each planet has <a href="./lives">lives</a> that can be deducted if asteroids hit its surface. 
            The amount of lives a planet has is specific to it.

          </h3>
          <h5 class="padding-none">
            Asteroids have varying types, masses, sizes, and shapes. 
            Because of their different masses, they can fly towards the planet as different speeds. 
            There are <a href="./asteroids">different types of asteroids</a> of different difficulties. 
            Some asteroids has a turret attached to it, aiming at the player's <a href="./sfo">SFO</a>. 
            If the spaceship gets hit, it will get <a href="./shooting_asteroids">stunned</a>! 
            The amount of lives deducted from planets depends on the type of asteroid that hit its surface.
